As a dedicated SME Credit Analyst, I excelled in analyzing financial statements, developing underwriting standards, and optimizing portfolio performance through proactive planning and effective communication. In my current role as a Team Lead at Grace and Mercy Household Improvement Investment Initiative, I've led a team of loan officers to ensure smooth branch operations and contributed to strategic planning sessions to drive business growth. My experience extends to industrial training at British American Tobacco, where I gained valuable insights into sustainable practices and problem-solving in a corporate setting. Certified as a Credit Risk Manager by the Chartered Institute of Risk and Loan Risk Management, I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python programming for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. My commitment to excellence, coupled with a keen eye for detail and a proactive approach, has consistently delivered tangible results in every role I've undertaken.
